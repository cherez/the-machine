Here's how to build your code using "make":
1) Choose the language you want (C++, Java, Python, or C#).
2) Find the "MakefileX" and "runX" where X is your language you wish to code in and copy them to Makefile and run, respectively
3) Now when you make it should make for the correct language you will be coding in!
4) Modify the AI file in the language you chose to make the best AI possible!
